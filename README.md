My name is Niall O’Donovan, and I have a deep passion for technology and a genuine enjoyment in helping others. While I am relatively new to the field of cybersecurity, I am extremely eager to gain practical experience and make a meaningful impact. I am seeking an entry-level cybersecurity position that will harness my drive and thirst for knowledge.
